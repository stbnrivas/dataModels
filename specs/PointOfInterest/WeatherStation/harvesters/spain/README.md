# FIWARE harvester - Spain weather stations

## Overview

It performs data harvesting using AEMET's data site as the origin and Orion Context Broker as the destination and
prepares a config that can be used by other harvesters, see the list in the [harvester](./spain_weather_stations.py).
It also exports data to the CSV file (./stations.csv), that can be used to upload the list of weather stations to
[Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1Sd5uNFd2um0GPog2EGkyrlzmBnEKzPQw).

## How to run

```console
docker run -t --rm fiware/harvesters:weather-stations-spain \
           --orion ${ORION_ENDPOINT} \
           --service ${FIWARE_SERVICE}
```

## Optional parameters

It is possible to limit the amount of parallel requests to the sources and Orion. See parameters in the
[harvester](./spain_weather_stations.py).

## API key

If you do not import the predefined list of stations, please provide an API key from AEMET. See the help at the header
of [harvester](./spain_weather_stations.py).
